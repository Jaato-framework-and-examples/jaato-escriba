"""No candidate is left unjudged.

Gates the judge's `signal_completion`: every URL it was handed must come
back in `aceptadas` or in `descartadas`, in exactly one of them.

WHY A GATE AND NOT JUST THE PERSONA.  Without this, the cheapest way to
answer is to return two accepted and say nothing about the other eight:
it validates against the schema, it looks like finished work, and those
eight vanish without anyone knowing whether they were even looked at.
And since the discard list is what stops the same URL being re-judged
tomorrow, a discard that goes unwritten is paid for on every future
search.

The candidate list is NOT read from the payload — which is what the model
writes, and therefore what it could dress up — but from `agent_params`,
which is what the driver passed when it created the session.

The error strings stay in Spanish because the judge reads them: they are
model-facing prose, like its persona and its schema descriptions.
